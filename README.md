The ever-increasing number of social media users has dramatically contributed to significant growth in the volume of online information concerned. Often, the content that these users put on social media can give valuable insights into their personalities (For example, in terms of predicting job satisfaction, specific preferences, as well as the success of professional and romantic relationships) and getting it without the hassle of taking a formal personality test. Termed personality prediction involves extracting the digital content into features and mapping it according to a personality model. Owing to its simplicity and proven capability, a well-known personality model is called the MBTI traits. To date, many algorithms can be used to extract embedded contextualized words from textual data for personality prediction systems; some are based on an ensemble model and deep learning. Although practical, existing algorithms such as RNN and LSTM have a few limitations. In this paper, we work on the XGboost model, which has been used before, but we especially focus on the accuracy of human personality prediction and how it increases than the previous. More precisely, our results achieve maximum accuracy of IE:78.90%, NS:86.17%, FT:74.05%, and JP:65.81%.
